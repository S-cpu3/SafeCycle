# Security Policy
At SafeCycle, Privacy and Security is our #1 priority. We treat all privacy and security issues seriously. If you believe you have found a security issue, please report it to us via the security tab. This is a Vulnerability Disclosure Programs (VDP) so any reports will not be rewarded with any financial compensation. However, the researcher who reported the issue first, will be credited on our Github page 

## Supported Versions
The most up to date verison of SafeCycle is in scope for reporting any security or privacy vulnerabilities. Out date verisons of SafeCycle submissions will not be accepted.

## Reporting a Vulnerability 
If you found a vulnerabilty, please follow the following steps: 
1. Clearly demonstrate the issue you found in your title.
2. Give the step by step instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
3. To make triage eaiser and smoother, include your Proof of concept (PoC) as an attachment.
4. You will be notified if you report was accepted or not.

All reports and the triage process will be handled by [Aaron]([https://github.com/S-cpu3])
